  # unit tests for get_available_balance

Enrollment is required.  _Supported account types_: \&quot;checking\&quot;, \&quot;savings\&quot;, \&quot;moneyMarket\&quot;, \&quot;cd\&quot;  _Supported regions_: ![üá∫üá∏](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)

  # unit tests for get_available_balance_live
  # Get Available Balance
  # Retrieve the available and cleared account balances for a single account in real-time directly from a financial institution.   You can define an additional query parameter &#x60;balance_cache_interval&#x60; to specify the time interval of the last cached balance. This parameter is used by the server to determine whether the cached balance is still valid or if it needs to be refreshed.     Note: this is a premium service, billable per every successful API call.  _Supported account types_: \&quot;checking\&quot;, \&quot;savings\&quot;, \&quot;moneyMarket\&quot;, \&quot;cd\&quot;  _Supported regions_: ![üá∫üá∏](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)
  # @param customer_id A customer ID
  # @param account_id The account ID
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :balance_cache_interval &#x60;balance_cache_interval&#x60; (in minutes) is used to decide whether to return existing cached balance or retrieve from financial institution in real-time. Details explained below: 1. If the cached balance data at server is older than provided &#x60;balance_cache_interval&#x60; then live balance from financial institution will be retrieved. 2. If the cached balance data is within provided &#x60;balance_cache_interval&#x60; allowed interval then balance from cache will be returned. 3. If &#x60;balance_cache_interval&#x60; is 0 or not provided, then live balance from financial institution will be retrieved.
