  # This will delete access to a specific account only.

The customer data on that specific account will no longer be accessible. Any customer data already collected will be retained in accordance with our enterprise retention policy consistent with legal and business purposes. â€‹ _Supported regions_: ![ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)

  # unit tests for refresh_customer_accounts
  # Refresh Customer Accounts
  # Refresh account and transaction data for all accounts associated with the  given &#x60;customerId&#x60; with a connection to the institution.  Client apps are not permitted to automate calls to the Refresh services. Active accounts are automatically refreshed by Finicity once per day. Because many financial institutions only post transactions once per day, calling Refresh services repeatedly is usually a waste of resources and is not recommended.  Apps may call Refresh services for a specific customer when there is a specific business case for the need of data that is up to date as of the moment. Please discuss with your account manager and systems engineer for further clarification.  The recommended timeout setting for this request is 120 seconds in order to receive a response. However, you can terminate the connection after making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to know when the refresh is complete.  Note: This service is not available for all Data Access Tiers.  _Supported regions_: ![ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)
