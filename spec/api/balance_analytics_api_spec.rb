  # Generate Balance Analytics
  # Balance Analytics for Business analyzes bank balances over time to report metrics and identify behavior that may indicate risk.  Calculated metrics include: * Current/available account balances * Minimum/maximum/average account balances over the requested time   period and broken down by month  * Daily ending balance of accounts for each day in the requested time   period  * Propensity of the customer&#39;s account balances to increase week over   week  * Number of days in the requested time period ending with a negative   balance   This version of the API is intended for piloting and integration testing your application with the Balance Analytics product. It does not adhere to FCRA requirements, and should not be used for production/lending purposes. See _Generate Balance Analytics - FCRA_ for the FCRA compliant version of this API.  A successful call to this API will generate analytics and store a report within Finicity. The report can be retrieved via _Get Balance Analytics Report_ (operation: _GetObbAnalyticsReport_).  _Supported regions_: ![ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)
