  # unit tests for create_token
  # Create Access Token
  # Send Partner ID and Partner Secret to the Partner Authentication service to obtain a token for accessing Finicity APIs. * The token is valid for two hours and is required on all calls to the Finicity APIs * As a best practice, use a single token for all calls. Assign a timestamp for each token, and then check the current timestamp before making any calls. If the token is greater than 90 minutes, generate a new one. * ‚ö†Ô∏è After five failed attempts to authenticate, your account will be locked. To reset your account, you can report a support issue using the support.finicity.com portal. Alternatively, contact your Client Success Manager or your onboarding representative.  _Supported regions_: ![üá∫üá∏](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)

  # unit tests for modify_partner_secret
  # Modify Partner Secret
  # Change the Partner Secret used to authenticate this partner.  The secret does not expire, but can be changed by calling this API. A valid Partner Secret may contain upper and lowercase characters, numbers, and the characters !, @, #, $, %, &amp;, *, _, -, +. It must include at least one number and at least one letter, and its length should be between 12 and 255 characters.  _Supported regions_: ![üá∫üá∏](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)
