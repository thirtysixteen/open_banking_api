  # unit tests for get_report_by_consumer
  # Get Report by Consumer and ID
  # Get a report that has been generated by a previous call to one of the Generate Report services.  The report&#39;s &#x60;status&#x60; field contains \&quot;inProgress\&quot;, \&quot;failure\&quot;, or \&quot;success\&quot;. If the status shows \&quot;inProgress\&quot;, the client app should wait 20 seconds and then call this API again.  Report data can either be retrieved as a JSON document or a PDF file.  To specify the format required, set the _Accept request header_ to either **application/json** or **application/pdf**. If neither is set, the report format will be returned as a JSON document.  _Supported regions_: ![ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)
